Joomla 3.9x and SP Page Builder was applied, and a commercial template was used from the Nelspruit site to stay in line with the company's corporate identity.

The actual rough code for this is on our Wiki for anyone to view and incorporate into their site. \n\nI would also like to give Kudos to Regular Labs Sourcer, which is not only an exceptionally useful component, but gives site owners a quick and dirty way to test code before embedding.","title":"GENSupport (A Division of GEN)","metrics":{"performance":23,"firstContentfulPaint":7.7,"firstMeaningfulPaint":7.8,"firstCPUIdle":7.8,"interactive":8.8,"bestPractices":71,"accessibility":86,"seo":100,"carbon":0.06}},{"href":"https://www.americanmassagetraining.co.uk","text":"We created this site in its entirety on behalf of Web Design Unlimited and write this with their permission.\n\nThis was a bespoke design coded using Gantry 5 and the Hydrogen template (their most lightweight template).  We used custom SCSS, custom modules, plugins and plenty of overrides to get the site looking this way.\n\nModules include a breakout module where the image breaks out of its container.  All are editable by the client.  All-in-all there are about 5-10 custom modules and plugins. You can see the breakout module in our images where the image breaks out of the central container when it should end with the same margin as the text (but opposite).  We also show a version of the module for the events with an image and without.  FAQs is a Joomla Articles Intro module restyled.  \n\nWe used Joom Donation's Event Booking as the event and booking system but we overrode the modules to be bespoke.  We also created Gantry 5 layouts and submitted them back to Joom Donation via the Forum.This client had a good idea and a very complex brief which we could only meet by using Joom Donations Event Booking component.  No other Joomla! or WordPress component/plugin could do what they required.\n\nThe client was technical enough to use a computer, but not highly skilled with a CMS and initially requested WordPress and the Yoast plugin.  We explained that their brief would have to be altered if they used a WordPress plugin, and offered PWT SEO as a Yoast alternative - which they now like.\n\nWe created custom admin overrides with instructions to use the events booking software, custom dashboard (cpanel) shortcut buttons so the menu was less confusing (we could have used an admin menu but we didn't).  We also created custom helper videos in the dashboard so they would not need to come back in 6 months and relearn the information.  \n\nThe client is elated with the outcome.","title":"American Massage Training UK - Bespoke Event Website","metrics":{"performance":65.66666666666667,"firstContentfulPaint":1.5333333333333334,"firstMeaningfulPaint":2.433333333333333,"firstCPUIdle":6.3,"interactive":7.466666666666666,"bestPractices":79,"accessibility":92,"seo":97,"carbon":0.067}},{"href":"https://coverac.com.gr","text":"Construction Hand Car Covers custom is our main objective. \n\nWe provide: patterns that are cut to the measures of each salon so follow the manufacturer's line and leaving intact the wallpaper application covers satisfy the most demanding.Joomla 3++, Virtuemart, Akeeba backup, SP Page Builder, ITP Meta, OS Map, VP One Page Checkout.

To showcase new models, we installed SP Page Builder and each model accurately reflects the layout on the manufacturer site but without links to other dealers.  They wanted to present their managers through this platform and feature a live chat, so customers can connect instantly with the dealer.  We always promise that two clicks are the limit for the user to navigate from home page to the information they are searching for.  We planned carefully to keep navigation simple, professional with lead generation the primary goal for the client.This site was designed from the client brief which required the showcase of new models of Nissan, Datsun, Renault and UD Trucks.  We used SP Page Builder to create professional listings with easy access for dealer / client engagement.  For pre-owned vehicles, our own component Auto Digital was used.  Services from the dealer were made simple and we used one contact form, live chat and Facebook to ensure the client was able to connect instantly.  The site requires extensive SEO, social media campaigns to promote new and pre-owned listings that link back to our platform.  Joomla 3.x, Auto Digital, Auto Customer which displays images and comments to new customers taking ownership of their vehicle and SP Page Builder were the key components used to meet the requirements in the brief, this was an easy project, the brief was clear, and we used really good quality components which are user friendly for the client.","title":"Thompson Motors South Coast","metrics":{"performance":8.666666666666666,"firstContentfulPaint":8.833333333333334,"firstMeaningfulPaint":8.833333333333334,"firstCPUIdle":9.4,"interactive":12.933333333333332,"bestPractices":64,"accessibility":56,"seo":92,"carbon":0.169}},{"href":"https://varusdrums.com","text":"Custom handmade Drums with international projection.\nShows the drums models and international artists who support the brand.Website in three languages with special form to request estimates online.","title":"Varus Custom Drums","metrics":{"performance":49.333333333333336,"firstContentfulPaint":4.333333333333333,"firstMeaningfulPaint":4.333333333333333,"firstCPUIdle":6.566666666666666,"interactive":7.366666666666667,"bestPractices":71,"accessibility":80,"seo":91,"carbon":0.215}},{"href":"https://presvac.com/","text":"Presvac Systems Inc. has been a leader in vacuum truck manufacturing for over 45 years.

However their website was in need of an upgrade and redesign. They also needed to revise their operating structure.\n\nWhen the website was first developed using Joomla 1.5, the business was still in its early days and they had chosen not to invest in features such as online booking and payment engine. Instead they used the services provided through third party online booking sites (OTAs). While these relationships helped to grow their business through added visibility and reach, this invariably meant a large portion of income from every booking was regularly paid out in commissions.\n\nWaterfront Rest B&B was poised for growth. They knew that in the long run, they needed to become independent, and bring such features under their direct control. This would ensure that they were future-proofing the business for growth.\nThe Approach\nThe business was ready to upgrade and redesign its Joomla website while ensuring full synchronisation with back-office operations. They were happy to continue using Joomla as they were aware of the security it provided, a very important criteria if they were to start accepting bookings through the site. They also knew about the built-in enhanced SEO capabilities, another key component which they wanted to maximise through the new site.\n\nFrom a business perspective, top priority was the need to have real-time room-availability accessible on several channels; the site had to be fully responsive and easily accessible for online bookings on mobiles and tablets. Equally, the site had to remain bi-lingual to cater for French visitors.\n\nThey approached Puma IT, who had built their first Joomla site and were acknowledged experts in Joomla sites. With their help, they mapped out their requirements, highlighting elements they considered essential for the smooth running of their operation, as well as other features which would help them maintain their online visibility and ease-of-use for site visitors.\n\nPuma IT handled the Joomla CMS upgrade and refreshed the template with the new design. They successfully managed the new build within a short, four months’ time-frame. Many of the required features were out-of-the-box elements in Joomla Core, making it a seamless and secure operation to revise and upgrade the existing site.\nThese features included:Seamless content and structure migration from existing site, including bilingual contentResponsive design optimised for mobile & tabletTemplate refreshMultilingual elements (French, English)Third-Party Extensions:Booking solution with payment engineFeatured backend software with multiple rooms managementSocial media integrationIndependent and yet fully synchronized with the main Online Travel Agents(OTS)Automated email system for reservation reminder, invoice, follow up message, customized reservation process and user interfaceThe Result\nWithin a few months, Waterfront Rest B&B saw a 12% increase in direct bookings. Furthermore, their online ranking and traffic were similarly increasing month-on-month.\n\nIn the following years, uploading and setting up the website for the next season was a breeze: updating prices, change of room-types availability between high and low season periods, and synchronising with OTAs channel with a different pricing structure than their website (direct booking). The new website now allows them to adapt easily and quickly to changes in the hospitality market within this highly competitive touristic region.\n\nAs Puma IT commented, since the site was already built using Joomla, the refresh and redesign was a seamless and painless project. Many of the features were already included in the Joomla core, thus ensuring stability and security to both the site and the booking system. It also reduced the need for numerous third-party plugins","title":"Waterfront Rest B&B - Independent Booking and Reservation solution","metrics":{"performance":31,"firstContentfulPaint":4.8,"firstMeaningfulPaint":5.033333333333332,"firstCPUIdle":8.033333333333333,"interactive":10.033333333333333,"bestPractices":57,"accessibility":62,"seo":82,"carbon":0.18400000000000002}},{"href":"https://scr888.group","text":"Official 918KISS or SCR888 group website, you can purchase 918KISS or SCR888 credit and application for 918KISS or SCR888 agent account, topup 918KISS or SCR888 agent account. \nAnd customer support for 918KISS or SCR888.Build with latest Joomla 3.x with with minimal components, games template, live support chat.","title":"918KISS (SCR888) Group","metrics":{"performance":77.33333333333333,"firstContentfulPaint":2.3,"firstMeaningfulPaint":3.4333333333333336,"firstCPUIdle":4.933333333333334,"interactive":5.533333333333334,"bestPractices":68.66666666666667,"accessibility":43,"seo":91,"carbon":0.19633333333333333}},{"href":"https://bpug.nl/","text":"BPUG - The Best Practice User Group for Portfolio, Programme and Project Management, as well as other products in the Swirl Portfolio now maintained by Axelos for the Cabinet Office and TSOWebsite build with #Yootheme #RSJoomla and other great products for joomla!","title":"BPUG Best Practice User Group PRINCE2 LEAN AGILE","metrics":{"performance":81.33333333333333,"firstContentfulPaint":2.4333333333333336,"firstMeaningfulPaint":2.4333333333333336,"firstCPUIdle":2.533333333333333,"interactive":2.6,"bestPractices":86,"accessibility":87,"seo":100,"carbon":0.027}},{"href":"https://vietnamtour.com","text":"Xin Chao!\nAt Vietnam Tour our mission is to provide an authentic travel experience that intimately connects you to the cultures of Southeast Asia.\n\nFrom the big picture to the tiniest detail, our experts, English-speaking guides share the Indochina of the people, making you a special guest on a one-of-a-kind vacation you will never forget.

With an extensive selection of vehicles, ranging from prestige, executive and extravagant, to city runaround, jeeps, sports, fun, economy and family models, this established business is committed to providing great service with secure and reliable rentals at value rates.\n\nFurthermore, Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental has modern, state-of-the-art car rental facilities which were designed for a super-efficient and fast service. The business also includes a garage where it services its fleet of vehicles.\n\nPreviously, the company website was designed to serve as an online brochure without any ordering/booking tools and facilities. However, as businesses, individuals and travelers adopted web and mobile tools for their car rental and travel requirements, the company realised that it had to add these functions to its website in order not to miss out on webbased business.The Challenge\nDollar/Thrifty Car Rental wanted to capitalise on the use of online tools, including subscriptions for newsletters, a booking system for car rentals and a back-office operation integrated with its off-line business. It also wanted to refresh the website with a new design.\n\nFor a number of years, the company was using Joomla 1.5. They had no reason to change to another CMS system as they were happy with the performance, security and look and feel of the site. They were at a stage when the site was beginning to look tired and required a major upgrade to the Joomla core in order to bring it up-to-date. As they also wanted to introduce new functionalities, it has been decided to rebuild the site from scratch. The completely new Joomla website would also provide a better online experience for customers and ensure a continued secure environment for the planned car rental online booking system.\nThe Approach\nDollar/Thrifty Car Rental approached web agency IDIMweb to build the new website. After consulting with the client, IDIMweb created a new web design that included a seamless online booking system tailored for car rentals, multilingual capabilities, (initially with French and English, followed by Spanish) and a call-to-action for newsletter subscriptions as well as social media. The site would be fully responsive and optimized for multi-lingual SEO. All this would allow the business to evolve into a multi-channel seamless operation, and bring the online presence up-to-date, thus improving their brand visibility and operational security.\n\nIDIMweb built a new website, still based on Joomla but using a new version - this meant they could adopt the latest web standards and include modern technologies. The site also required custom PHP development to tailor it for the company and location, and here IDIMweb worked in collaboration with Natural Selection Web Design. The new website was a step forward for Dollar/Thrifty Car Rental, allowing it to combine its online and offline rental operation within a consistent experience across multiple platforms.\nMultilanguage Features from Joomla 3.x (French, English)Responsive design, smartphone and tablet-readyNew custom templateThird-Party Extensions:Newsletter SystemCustomized car rental componentCustomized Template (from a template club + custom CSS)Sitemap extensionGoogle MapExclusive font ...The Result\nThe refreshed Dollar Thrifty website has already been acknowledged as a leader on the Island.
